# Rockbuster - SQL
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Team plans to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive in the face of fierce competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. For this project, I imported all of Rockbuster's data into an RDBMS, performed SQL analysis on the data, and provided data-driven responses to ad hoc business queries that were utilized to inform their business plan. 

# Objective
Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has posed a number of business-related queries and is looking for data-driven responses.

Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which films generated the greatest or least amount of revenue gain?

● How long did each video rental last on average?

● Which nations are the bases of Rockbuster's customers?

● Customers with a high lifetime value are based where?

● Do sales numbers differ depending on the region?
