-- REFINING QUERIES 
-- Original query: Get some data from the "film" table and decide to use the query: 

SELECT * FROM film 

-- This shows all observations (rows and columns) in the film table

-- Revised query: Select two columns to view in the film table (film_id, title): 

SELECT film_id, title 
FROM film 

-- Compare the cost of the original query and the revised query: 

EXPLAIN 
SELECT * 
FROM film 

-- Seq Scan on film (cost=0.00..117.00 rows =1000 widith=384)

EXPLAIN 
SELECT film_id, title 
FROM film 

-- Seq Scan on film (cost=0.00..117.00 rows=1000 widith=19) 

-- The cost for both original and revised queries is the same at 0.00. 
-- The only thing thatâ€™s different is the width; the original query extracted results from ALL columns in the table which is why the width is at 384. 
-- The width in the revised query is much smaller at 19 because only 2 columns are extracted. 

-- ORDERING THE DATA 
-- Run a query that selects every film from the "film" table, with the movies sorted by title from A to Z, 
-- then by most recent release year, and then by highest to lowest rental rate: 

SELECT title, release_year, rental_rate 
FROM film 
ORDER BY rental_rate DESC, title 

-- GROUPING THE DATA 
-- Find the average rental rate for each rating category: 

SELECT rating, AVG (rental_rate) 
FROM film 
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY rating 

-- There are 5 rating categories on the MPAA rating scale. They are as followed: 
-- G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17. The average rating rate for each group is as followed: 
-- G (2.88), PG (3.05), PG-13 (3.03), R (3.93), and NC-17 (2.97). PG holds the highest average rental rate, and G the lowest. 

-- Find the minimum and maximum rental durations for each rating category: 

SELECT rating, MIN (rental_duration), MAX (rental_duration) 
FROM film 
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY rating 

-- 3 is the minimum and 7 is the maximum. 

-- CHECK FOR DIRTY DATA 
-- Find duplicate data: 

SELECT  title, 
        release_year, 
        language_id,
        rental_duration, 
        COUNT(*)
FROM film 
GROUP BY  title, 
          release_year, 
          language_id, 
          rental_duration 
HAVING COUNT(*) >1; 

-- There are no duplicate data. The SELECT and GROUP BY functions are mirrored by columns selected. 
-- HAVING COUNT(*)>1 tells the system to find a record that's repeated more than once. As a result, there are none. 

-- Find non-uniform data: 

SELECT rating
FROM film 
GROUP BY rating 

SELECT language_id 
FROM film 
GROUP BY language_id 

SELECT rental_rate 
FROM film 
GROUP BY rental_rate 
ORDER BY rental_rate 

SELECT rental_duration 
FROM film 
GROUP BY rental_duration 
ORDER BY rental_duration 

-- All are quick queries to find non-uniform data because they contain tuples that contain enum values. Based on what I found: 
-- Rating: G, PG, PG-13, NC-17, R 
-- Language ID: 1 (all of the films in the database are in English) 
-- Rental rate: 0.99, 2.99, and 4.99 
-- Rental duration: between 3 and 7 days 

-- Find missing data 

SELECT language_id 
FROM film 
WHERE language_id IS NULL 

SELECT rental_duration 
FROM film 
WHERE rental_duration IS NULL 

SELECT rating 
FROM film 
WHERE rating IS NULL 

SELECT rental_rate 
FROM film 
WHERE rental_rate IS NULL 

-- I ran several queries to find missing data or null data in selected columns. 
-- However, I do notice that the release_year column contains errors; All observations are set to '1999' in release_year.
